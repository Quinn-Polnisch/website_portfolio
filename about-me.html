                    I grew up in Southern California and attended elementary, middle, and high 
                    school in a suburb of Los Angles known as Redondo Beach.  I graduated from 
                    Redondo Union High School in the spring of 2019.  During high school I took 
                    a few computer science courses and enjoyed them as well as physics.  Also while 
                    I was in high school I took classes at the community college in math and astronomy. 
                    Outside of school I did ballet all throughout high school and even considered trying 
                    to persue it as a career, but when it came time to decide what college to go to, I looked 
                    at all of my acceptance packages and thought about what I wanted to do after college. I eventually 
                    settled on The University of New Mexico persuing a degree in Physics with a Concentration in Optics.
                    Additionally, I joined Air Force ROTC with the end goal of becoming a pilot in the Air 
                    Force. After COVID hit and everything started changing I reevaluated what I really wanted to 
                    do with my life and that was being a pilot commercially, so I transfered to Southern Utah University 
                    and started persuing a degree in Aviation Studies Fixed-Wing. After taking some classes online 
                    in the aviation program and learning more about the program I decided that the cost was not worth
                    it. After two years at The University of New Mexico and one year (part-time) at Southern Utah 
                    University I dropped out of college to start looking for other ways to becoming a 
                    commercial pilot.

                I come from a small immediate family with a large extended family.  I have one brother who is 
                two years older than me, and a decent amount of aunts, uncles, and cousins all verying in age. 
                Most importantly is my fiance, Olivia. We have been engaged for a couple of months now and I 
                couln't be happier. Before moving to Upstate New York we rescued a kitten, Sebastian, who just 
                celebrated his first birthday in February. He is wonderful to be around, most of the 
                time, he can make coding difficult, especially when he decides he wants to learn.  Olivia and I, 
                are patiently awaiting the arrival of our first baby due in August of this year.  It is 
                exciting to be starting a family together especially since we our in the process of renovating
                our own home which hopefully will be down within a year.

                When it comes to hobbies mine are extensive and diverse.  Growing up I was encouraged to go outside
                a lot, which created a love of the outdoors and the unknown that is out there.  I enjoy going on bike rides 
                whether it be a casual cruize along the beach or a more intense mountain biking adventure. Along with 
                biking I have hiked many mountains on both the west coast and east coast. Something that I would like 
                to achieve at some point is becoming a 46'er, hiking all 46 mountains in the Adirondacks that are over
                4,600 feet MSL.  I have found that I enjoy the winter activities like skiing more enjoyable than hiking 
                because you can always put on another layer if you are cold.  While I was growing up I spent as much 
                time as I could at our family cabin in Southern Utah, and that instilled in me a love of the night sky, 
                so while I was in highschool I took a college course on building a telescope and built my own telescope.
                Part of building the telescope was making the stand for it, which I designed and built out of scrap wood
                I found in my parents garage. Another one of my hobbies that I don't get to do very often is wood working.
                One year for my birthday I got a wood lathe on which I made many a pens and other random things I wanted to.
                Lastly, my biggest hobby is aviation; in August of 2022 I passed my Private Pilot Checkride, which was the 
                first step to me becoming a commercial pilot. If I could I would go flying everyday and never tire of it.

                When I get asked why I decided to do this bootcamp many reasons come to mind. The first being financial 
                security.  In the last year I have had a few jobs in two different states, and for most of them 
                there wasn't much financial stability. It was either not enough money or not enough hours with 
                ends up being not enough money when it comes time to pay the bills. Not only will it be nice to do 
                something for my family that will enable us to live a comfortable lifestyle coding is something 
                I have always enjoyed and will continue to enjoy.  Not only will I gain financial security, 
                I will also have the ability to continue persuing aviation as a potential career, but most 
                importantly as a hobby. Another benefit to going into this field is it one of the few high 
                paying jobs that can be done completely remotely which is something that I would prefer because
                I will be able to be with my family more if I am working from home.
